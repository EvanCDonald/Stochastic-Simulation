# Stochastic-Simulation
As a hobby, and in order to improve my python and C++ skills, I intend to build a python library for simulation and integration of stochastic processes (starting with Ito processes, and maybe extending to some jump processes).

I will probably start by coding standalone programs in python, then C++, then maybe try and do a python wrapper around C++ code.  Hopefully the end result will be a fully self contained library for python with underlying C++ for speed, like numpy or pandas.
